- Use pytest for testing.
- Implement unit tests to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
- Aim for high test coverage (90% or higher).
- Test both common cases and edge cases.
- Keep tests independent of each other.
- Make tests deterministic (same input always gives same output).
- Write tests that are fast and efficient.
- Avoid test code duplication.
